Future Improvements:

- Cross browser testing
    - All browsers and their drivers need to be downloaded and installed
    - A common function to be able to specify the browser via command line for the tests to run
    - headless browsers to improve the speed of the tests

- Linting rules to keep consistent with the test scripts
- Auto generated users, with access to the api's we can randomly generate users and sign them up more efficiently, to do the login tests
- Email and Password to be separated out of the repository
- Api tests, with access to the api docs, there are plenty of api tests to be implemented

* The Scenario listed below is failing due to a bug, the user's email address should be filled in if remember me is checked, however this functionality is broken.
This has also been tested manually to confirm.
User's email is prefilled when remember me is selected
