Future Improvements:

- Cross browser testing
    - All browsers and their drivers need to be downloaded and installed
    - A common function to be able to specify the browser via command line for the tests to run
    - headless browsers to improve the speed of the tests

- Linting rules to keep consistent with the test scripts
